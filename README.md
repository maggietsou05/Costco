# Background

In April 2024, my team and I stepped into the shoes of Costco’s senior strategy group for the Global Business Case Competition (GBCC).<br><br>
With 24 hours on the clock, we were asked to chart Costco’s next wave of international growth in 3 respective countries: Brazil, India, and the United Arab Emirates

> My role: Strategy lead – market scoring, quantitative analysis, and implementation roadmap <br>
 Deliverable: A board-level presentation pitched to Costco’s CFO and Starbucks’ CEO

# Insights & Recommendation Breakdown

**India – Joint Venture (JV)**
- 100% foreign direct investment allowed in B2B e-commerce only.
- JV with local logistics or wholesale partner minimizes tax liability (30%) and eases compliance.
- Product localization and regional warehousing are key to long-term scale.

**UAE – Wholly Owned in Free Trade Zone**
- Establish in Jebel Ali Free Zone (JAFZA) for 100% foreign ownership.
- No corporate tax, fast registration, advanced logistics infrastructure.
- Omnichannel strategy with real-time inventory and click-and-collect.

**Brazil – Delayed Entry with JV**
- Bureaucracy and protectionist policies favor local partnerships.
- Tax and customs reforms beginning 2026 reduce initial friction.
- JV reduces regulatory exposure and aligns with government procurement policies.<br><br>
